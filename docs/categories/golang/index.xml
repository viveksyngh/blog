      <title>Pass by value and Pass by reference in Go</title>

      <description>In Go, everything is passed by value. When we pass arguments to a function, a function always gets the copy of the data passed. For example, passing an int value to function makes a copy of the int, passing a pointer value makes a copy of the pointer but not the data it points to.
When we pass a value to function it is called pass by value and when we pass a pointer to a function it is called pass by reference.</description>

      <description>Sometimes in our applications, we need to invoke external processes or commands (e.g CURL, Ping, SSH etc.) to perform some tasks. We can use os/exec Go package to invoke external processes. Most of the time we want to invoke these commands with timeouts.Â In this blog post, I am going to talk about the different ways in which we can invoke a command with a timeout.
Timeout with timer In this method, we will use a timer for the timeout.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I am going to talk about HTTP server and how to respond with different types of HTTP response(text, JSON, template) in Go.
Creating a web server in Go is very simple and we can do it by writing just a few lines of code. To create an HTTP server in go you need to use net/http package. This is how a simple HTTP server code looks like in Go.</description>
