It all started in October 2017, I was actively looking for open source project to contribute when I came to know about [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). It is a month-long celebration of open source software organized by [Github](https://github.com/) and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). 

While browsing through the Hacktoberfest listed issues, I found an open issue from [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/). OpenFaaS project is written in Golang. Back then I knew python and had started learning Golang. I thought to give it a try.I started working on the solution and after few changes and testing, I got my pull request merged to OpenFaaS.

When my first Pull-request got merged, I was invited by [Alex Ellis](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk) to OpenFaaS community slack group. I really liked the community and the project and started spending more time on it.

As I had experience with Docker and Docker Swarm, I got OpenFaaS up and running on Docker swarm easily. I wrote few sample functions for the store and got understanding of how OpenFaaS works. Then, I started going through OpenFaaS project code and tried to pick beginner level issues.

Since then I have been an active contributor to the OpenFaaS project and got several pull request merged to OpenFaaS. 
Recently, I got my OpenFaaS swag and a hand-written thank you note from [Alex Ellis](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk).

I also hosted a session on Serverless and OpenFaaS in my current organization. Here are few pictures.

I participated and completed Hacktoberfest 2017 successfully and received my Hacktoberfest T-Shirt.
I recommend Hacktoberfest to anybody who wants to get started with Open Source Contribution.
