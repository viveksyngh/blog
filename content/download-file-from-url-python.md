This blog post is about how to download an image or other static content from a URL in python.

I am going to accomplish this without any additional python package. We will look at two different solutions for Python2 and Python3. So Letâ€™s get started.

Before we start downloading the file, we need to get the filename from the URL. The string after the last backslash in URL is the filename.

```python
def get_filename(url):
    if url.find('/'):
        return url.rsplit('/', 1)[1]
```
Above snippet of code will return the filename.

#### Python2:

```python
import urllib

def download_file(url):
    filename = get_filename(url)
    if filename is None:
        print("Filename not found")
        return
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename)
```

#### Python3:
```python
import urllib.request

def download_file(url):
    filename = get_filename(url)
    if filename is None:
        print("Filename not found")
        return
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)
```
